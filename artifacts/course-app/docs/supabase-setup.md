# Supabase setup

## Environment variables

Add these exact names to the Replit environment:

- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` — the Supabase project URL.
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` — the Supabase anon/publishable key used by the browser.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` — the private service-role key used only by the API server to create short-lived media links.

The two `VITE_` values are included in the browser bundle and must not contain secrets. Keep the service-role key private: do not rename it with a `VITE_` prefix, add it to source control, or expose it to the browser.

## Database setup

1. Create the administrator account in Supabase Authentication using the email and password you want to use.
2. In `supabase/schema.sql`, replace `YOUR_ADMIN_EMAIL_HERE` with that exact email address. Run the entire file in the Supabase SQL Editor. The final block registers the existing Auth account as a course administrator.
3. Run the entire `supabase/courses.sql` file in the SQL Editor. It creates the course tables, RPCs, private `course-media` bucket, and storage policies. If the course database is already installed, run `supabase/course-content-notes-thumbnails.sql` once instead to add learner-visible lesson notes and private video thumbnails.
4. Run the entire `supabase/chat.sql` file in the SQL Editor. It creates one shared group chat and the private `chat-media` bucket. Learner messaging starts enabled; chat attachments are limited to 50 MB per file.
   If `chat.sql` was already installed before the learner/admin sender fix, run `supabase/fix-chat-sender-identity.sql` once in the SQL Editor.
5. Restart the app and API server after adding the environment variables. Sign in at `/admin/sign-in`; learners start at `/`.

There is no sample course content. Create and publish a course from the admin area after setup.

## Media-protection limits

Course and chat media are stored privately and delivered through signed links after the app checks access. In the browser, the learner app blocks common copy, print, save, source-view and screenshot shortcuts when the browser exposes them, disables the context menu and dragging, limits selection, hides download/remote-playback controls, and pauses media when the page is hidden. These measures deter casual copying only. A website cannot reliably prevent operating-system screenshots or screen recordings, and signed links can still be captured while valid. Do not treat the web version as DRM or perfect anti-copy protection.

For an Android APK, the native Android wrapper must enable `FLAG_SECURE` for learner screens. This blocks standard Android screenshots and screen recordings while those screens are visible, but does not prevent external-camera recording or capture on a compromised device. The project does not yet include an Android wrapper; wire this native setting into the wrapper after choosing the APK packaging approach.
